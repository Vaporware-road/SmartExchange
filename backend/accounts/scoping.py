"""Per-account data isolation.

One deployment serves many self-serve customers, so every row of customer data
belongs to exactly one :class:`accounts.models.Account`. Rather than filter at
each of the ~700 call sites, the models that own data ("roots") get an
``account`` FK and this module's manager, which narrows every default queryset
to the account of the request in flight. Child rows are reached through their
parent's FK and need neither a column nor a manager.

The current account lives in a :class:`~contextvars.ContextVar` so it survives
``async``/threadpool hops and cannot leak between concurrently handled
requests the way a module global would.

Scoping **fails closed**: with no account set, a scoped manager yields nothing.
Silently returning every row would turn one forgotten ``set_current_account``
into a cross-customer data leak, whereas failing closed surfaces as an obvious
empty list. Code that legitimately spans accounts — Celery tasks, webhooks,
management commands, the owner console — says so out loud with :func:`unscoped`
or :func:`act_as_account`, both of which grep cleanly.
