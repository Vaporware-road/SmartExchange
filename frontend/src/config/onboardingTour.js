/**
 * Guided tour shown on a new customer's first sign-in.
 *
 * One step per thing the panel actually does, in the order a rate desk uses it:
 * quote → publish → brand → measure → ask for help. `to` is the panel route the
 * step opens; copy resolves to `onboarding.tour.steps.<key>.title` / `.body` /
 * `.look`.
 *
 * `permission` hides a step the signed-in role cannot open (see config/permissions).
 * The final `support` step has no route: it renders the live support channels
 * so the answer to "who do I ask?" is never a dead phone number in a template.
